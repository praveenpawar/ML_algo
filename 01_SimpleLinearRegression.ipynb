    "Here we have HouseSize, NoOfRooms and Price are the feature. House Price is dependent feature as it depends on the other two Independent feature HouseSize, NoOfRooms. \n",
    "Output feature i.e. House Price values could be any numeric values ex. 150k, 250k etc.\n",
    "Due to numeric nature this becomes the Regression problem statement.\n",
